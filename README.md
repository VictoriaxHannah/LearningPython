# Learning Python
Here you'll find the fun test scripts I make as I learn Python.

## Scripts
```billionsecondbirthday.py```

This Python script will calculate the date and time of your Billion Second Birthday!

At approximately 31 years old, you'll have been alive for 1,000,000,000 seconds.
Using the date and time of your birth, my code will tell you the date and time of your Billion Second Birthday.

The time zone is set to ```Europe/London```, and the script takes into account Daylight Saving.
Leap seconds do not need accounting for, as only hours and minutes are used and there have only ever been 27 leap seconds added.

```primenumbers.py```

This Python script will find all the prime numbers in a user input range.
It will output both the number of primes found, and what they are.

## Goals
* To improve the speed and efficiency of my Python coding,
* To improve my critical analysis of code, and be able to think of the scenarios in which it'll fail (and hopefully code a way in which they can work)

## Ideas
* ~~Billion Second Birthday~~
* ~~Prime Number Calculator~~
* Calculator for the angle between two vectors
